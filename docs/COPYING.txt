WinTin++ combines three components that all fall under the GNU Generic Public License. The first component is the Cygwin DLL which allows programs written for linux systems to run on Windows. The second component is the compiled TinTin++ source code. The third component is mintty, a PuTTY derived VT100 terminal emulator for Cygwin.
